# Sales_Forecasting

Sales forecasting or predicting future sales essentially means to use past figures to predict short-term or long-term performance of the organization.
Accurately predicting the future sales can help one in managing the cash flow and financing needs in a structured manner.
In this project, I am working with data about shops, the corresponding items they hold and historical time series data about the transactions to predict future sales. 
We go through various steps like cleaning the data, performing some analysis, useful clustering to finally make our way to predicting how the sales would look like in near future.

All the required data files are in the data folder except for df_combined_mean.csv which can be accessed through https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/data
